    markdown: `I joined TicketSwap as the designer responsible for the buying experience, working to improve the core checkout flow and drive the visual redesign of the app.

**The goal:** Remove unnecessary steps, improve the experience for all buyers, and set the stage for commercial initiatives while modernizing the app's visual identity.

# **Redesigning the App's Checkout Flow**

The checkout flow is the core flow of the buying team. When I joined the team, I started working on redesigning the flow with the goal of removing unnecessary steps, improving the experience for all buyers and setting the stage to start experimenting with commercial initiatives.

# **Offering Extras at Checkout**

To support the company's commercial ambitions, the new checkout screen is designed to accommodate extras to add to the order. My goal was to strike a balance between giving high visibility to extra products while keeping the checkout process straightforward for buyers who just want to pay for their tickets.

# **Defining a New Visual Identity for the Apps**

My largest focus outside of the work I do with my product team has been to lead the effort to modernise the look and feel of the TicketSwap mobile app. With this new look, the goal is to make the product look more inline with the current UI design standards and to let TicketSwap's unique identity shine through its product.

This new identity was defined by working with the team on a vision for the future of the app and then summarised under 8 principles. It is now being implemented in the live app step by step.

# **Key Achievements**

**Commercial Integration:**

# **Reflections on the Process**

My main takeaways from leading both product and visual design at TicketSwap:

- **User-first approach**: Even when adding commercial features, prioritize the core user experience
- **Design systems matter**: Establishing clear principles early prevents design debt and improves team efficiency
- **Incremental implementation**: Large visual changes work best when implemented step by step
- **Cross-team collaboration**: Working closely with product and engineering teams ensures design decisions are both beautiful and feasible`
